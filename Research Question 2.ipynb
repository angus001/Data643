    "The number one surprising point from the video was that GraphLab outperformed a custom built Spark library- MLlib by Johnson and team. In the video, it was show that GraphLab only took 291 seconds to perform ALS algorithm whereas MLib took 481 seconds. Johnson did argue Graphlab was too specific and imply won’t be good for “general purpose” systems. I wonder how much GraphLab can be scaled up with AWS. Spark does support python language and scala.  \n"

    "Hadoop and Spark are considered both big data tools to be able handle millions of observations. Johnson’s video however showed that since Hadoop had to write to disk for iterative recommendation system, it suffered from IO bottle neck problem. On the other hands, Spark was able to store the ratings of the customers into memory and each iteration only need an eigenvector calculation. Therefore, the IO bottle neck problem was solved.\n"
